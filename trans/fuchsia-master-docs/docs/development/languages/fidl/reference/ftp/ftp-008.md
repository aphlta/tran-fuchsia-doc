## Summary  摘要 

The goal of this proposal is to allow a server to send a message prior to closing a connection that provides an indication of why the connection is beingclosed. While[epitaphs](../wire-format/README.md#epitaph-control-message-ordinal-0xffffffff)are covered in the specification, they are not implemented yet. 该提议的目标是允许服务器在关闭连接之前发送消息，该消息提供了为什么关闭连接的指示。虽然规范中涵盖了[epitaphs]（../ wire-format / README.mdepitaph-control-message-ordinal-0xffffffff），但尚未实现。

 
## Motivation  动机 

Currently, there is no standard way for servers to communicate to clients why a connection has been closed. This has the effect that the responsibility forensuring error handling falls to the developer.  The developer can eitherforesee this, and build special error handling into their message, or simplyignore error handling (and risk undiagnosable errors). 当前，服务器没有与客户端进行通信的标准方法来说明为什么已关闭连接。这具有确保错误处理的责任落在开发人员身上。开发人员可以预见到这一点，并在其消息中构建特殊的错误处理，或者只是忽略错误处理（并冒着无法诊断的错误的风险）。

One use case is for servers where errors are mostly fatal, and when they happen, all connections to clients are closed. In such cases, developers want ageneral-purpose error reporting mechanism, because all active calls to methodswill be terminated with the same error. The alternative of declaring a potentialerror for each method would be cumbersome and awkward. 一种用例是针对服务器，其中大多数错误都是致命的，并且在发生错误时，将关闭与客户端的所有连接。在这种情况下，开发人员需要通用错误报告机制，因为对方法的所有活动调用都将因相同的错误而终止。为每种方法声明潜在错误的替代方法是麻烦且尴尬的。

This FTP does not have a goal of providing an extensive error reporting mechanism. Specifically, the ability to communicate large amounts of detail(including detailed messages, process state, or propagated causes) to the otherend of the connection is out of scope. 此FTP的目标不是提供广泛的错误报告机制。具体地说，将大量详细信息（包括详细消息，过程状态或传播的原因）传达给连接另一端的能力超出了范围。

This FTP also does not have a goal of defining a set of common error codes.  此FTP也没有定义一组常见错误代码的目标。

 
## Design  设计 

This proposal modifies the wire format, the source language, and the first class language bindings. 该提议修改了线路格式，源语言和第一语言的绑定。

 
### Wire Format  连线格式 

The wire format specification currently has a section on Epitaphs. This section will be revised to read as follows: 有线格式规范当前有一节关于墓志铭。本节将修改如下：

 

```
Epitaph (Control Message Ordinal 0xFFFFFFFF)

An epitaph is a message with ordinal **0xFFFFFFFF**.  A server may send an
epitaph as the last message prior to closing the connection, to provide an
indication of why the connection is being closed.  No further messages may be
sent through the channel after the epitaph.  Epitaphs are not sent from clients
to servers.

When a client receives an epitaph message, it can assume that it has received
the last message, and the channel is about to be closed. The contents of the
epitaph message explain the disposition of the channel.

The epitaph contains an error status.  The error status of the epitaph is stored
in the reserved uint32 of the message header.  The reserved word is treated as
being of type **zx_status_t**: negative numbers are reserved for system error
codes, positive numbers are reserved for application error codes, and ZX_OK is
used to indicate normal connection closure.  The message is otherwise empty.
```
 

 
### Source Language  源语言 

The source language specification currently has a section on [Epitaphs](../language.md#interfaces).It will be updated appropriately. 源语言规范当前在[Epitaphs]（../ language.mdinterfaces）上有一节，将对其进行适当的更新。

 
### First class language bindings  一流的语言绑定 

Implementations should account for the fact that, if an Epitaph message is sent, it should be the last message prior to closure, and for the fact that errors arehandled differently in different languages (via, for example, delivery of errorcodes in C/C++, Result<T, E> in Rust, and exceptions in Dart). 实施过程应考虑以下事实：如果发送了墓志铭消息，则消息应是关闭前的最后一条消息，并且应考虑到错误在不同语言中的处理方式有所不同（例如，通过C / C ++传递错误代码， Rust中的Result <T，E>，Dart中的Exception）。

We will add a method fidl_epitaph_write(channel, zx_status_t) to the C bindings, as well as a fidl_epitaph_t type. 我们将在C绑定中添加方法fidl_epitaph_write（channel，zx_status_t）以及fidl_epitaph_t类型。

We will add the following documentation to the C bindings to the section on Raw Bindings: 我们将以下文档添加到原始绑定部分的C绑定中：

```
fidl_epitaph_write

Declared in lib/fidl/epitaph.h, defined in epitaph.c.

This function sends an epitaph with the given error number down the given
channel.  An epitaph is a special message, with ordinal 0xFFFFFFFF, which
contains an error code.  The epitaph must be the last thing sent down the
channel before it is closed.
```
 

 

CL for the C changes: https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/zircon/+/178250  C更改的CL：https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/zircon/+/178250

We will change the C++ bindings to do the following:  我们将更改C ++绑定以执行以下操作：

fidl::Binding will immediately close the channel on receipt of an Epitaph.  fidl :: Binding将在收到墓志铭后立即关闭通道。

Developers will be able to close the channel with fidl::Binding::Close  开发人员将能够使用fidl :: Binding :: Close关闭通道

Error codes will be propagated to the error handler set by the client using set_error_handler().  We will add a new error_handler variant that takes aclosure that takes an int variable representing the error code, and remove theexisting one.  Potential future work involves having a "sensible default" errorhandler, although it is not currently clear what this would be. 错误代码将传播到客户端使用set_error_handler（）设置的错误处理程序。我们将添加一个新的error_handler变体，该变体带有一个带有表示错误代码的int变量的闭包，并删除现有的变量。潜在的未来工作包括“明智的默认”错误处理程序，尽管目前尚不清楚这将是什么。

Any pending reads from this channel will return ```ZX_ERR_PEER_CLOSED```.  从该通道进行的所有未决读取都将返回“ ZX_ERR_PEER_CLOSED”。

The other bindings need to be updated, including Dart, Rust, and Go.  其他绑定需要更新，包括Dart，Rust和Go。

 
## Documentation and Examples  文档和示例 

 

The documentation will be updated as described in the previous section.  该文档将按照上一节中的描述进行更新。

 

 
### Guidance for Developers  开发人员指南 

The purpose of an epitaph is to enable a server to provide actionable information to the client regarding the disposition of the channel and requeststhat may have been in flight. 墓志铭的目的是使服务器能够向客户端提供有关通道的配置和可能正在运行的请求的可操作信息。

This section describes the intended behavior and usage of epitaphs.  本节描述墓志的预期行为和用法。

 
1. An epitaph message is only ever sent from a server to a client, never in the other direction.  If sent, it must be the last message sent by the server tothe client before the server closes its end of the channel. 墓志铭仅从服务器发送到客户端，而从不发送。如果已发送，则它必须是服务器关闭通道末尾之前服务器发送给客户端的最后一条消息。

 
2. When a client receives an epitaph message, it must immediately close its end of the channel.  It must not attempt to read any further messages from thechannel that may have been sent by a non-conforming server implementation. 2.客户收到墓志铭消息时，必须立即关闭其通道末端。它不得尝试从通道读取任何可能由不合格服务器实现发送的其他消息。

 
3. When a client observes peer closed without having received an epitaph, then it must proceed as if it has received a ```ZX_ERR_PEER_CLOSED``` epitaph;these two states are semantically equivalent. 3.当客户观察到对等方关闭而没有收到墓志铭时，则它必须像收到了“ ZX_ERR_PEER_CLOSED”墓志铭一样继续进行；这两个状态在语义上是等效的。

 
4. A server is expected to send a ```ZX_OK``` epitaph when the closure of the channel was an anticipated side-effect of the protocol reaching itsdesignated successful end state. 4.当通道的关闭是协议达到其指定的成功结束状态的预期副作用时，预计服务器将发送“ ZX_OK”墓志铭。

   a. Example: When a client calls Commit() on an interface representing an individual database transaction, the server should attempt to apply therequested changes.  If successful, the server must send a ```ZX_OK``` epitaphbefore closing its end of the channel.  The client may reasonably construethat the ```ZX_OK``` epitaph indicates that the transaction was successfullycommitted. 一种。示例：当客户端在表示单个数据库事务的接口上调用Commit（）时，服务器应尝试应用所请求的更改。如果成功，则服务器必须在关闭其通道末尾之前发送“ ZX_OK”墓志铭。客户可以合理地认为“ ZX_OK”墓志铭指示交易已成功完成。

   b. Counter-example: Many protocols do not have designated successful end states; the client expects to be able to connect to a server and issue anunbounded number of requests without observing peer closed until such time asthe client closes its own end of the channel.  In these situations, theserver closing its end of the channel constitutes an abnormal end state, sothe server should never send a ```ZX_OK``` epitaph. b。反例：许多协议没有指定成功的结束状态；客户端希望能够连接到服务器并发出无数个请求，而不会观察到对等端关闭，直到客户端关闭其自己的通道末端。在这些情况下，服务器关闭其通道的末端会构成异常的结束状态，因此服务器不应发送“ ZX_OK”墓志铭。

 
5. A server may send a non-```ZX_OK``` epitaph prior to closing its end of a channel for any reason other than the protocol reaching its designatedsuccessful end state.  We suggest the following convention: 5.服务器可能会由于协议达到其指定的成功结束状态以外的任何其他原因而在关闭其通道结束之前发送非“ ZX_OK”墓志铭。我们建议以下约定：

   a. If the server is closing the connection because the client sent it an malformed FIDL message, it should send a ```ZX_ERR_INVALID_ARGS``` epitaph. 一种。如果服务器由于客户端向其发送格式错误的FIDL消息而关闭了连接，则应发送“ ZX_ERR_INVALID_ARGS”墓志铭。

   ```ZX_ERR_BAD_STATE``` epitaph.

   c. If the server was unreachable (e.g. could not be started) when the client
   attempted to connect to it via a service discovery mechanism, this mechanism
   should send a ```ZX_ERR_UNAVAILABLE``` epitaph.  (See also this sketch.)

   d. If the server is unable to continue serving the protocol for reasons that
   are not in response to actions performed by the client (e.g. shutting down or
   out of memory), it does not have to send any epitaph.  The client will
   perceive this as ```ZX_ERR_PEER_CLOSED``` as described above.

   e. If a server encounters an application specific error, it should send an
   application-defined error code.  For example, if the server controls a
   filesystem, and the user tries to perform a write that it is not allowed to
   perform, it may wish to close the connection with an error.

   f. This list is not exhaustive.  A server may send other errors as
   appropriate.  As per usual, FIDL authors are advised to clearly document the
   errors their protocols may return, including epitaphs.

## Backwards Compatibility

The FIDL documentation currently states that 0x80000001 is the ordinal for an
epitaph.  We are changing it to 0xFFFFFFFF, because 0x80000001 is in use by IO.
Nothing is currently relying on Epitaphs using 0x80000001.  Otherwise, there
are no backwards compatibility concerns.

## Performance

n/a

## Security

Not applicable.

## Testing

Unittests for this feature will be added to the appropriate FIDL bindings. After
each supported FIDL binding gets support, we should augment the set of
[FIDL compatibility tests](/garnet/bin/fidl_compatibility_test/).

## Drawbacks, Alternatives, and Unknowns

We considered making a ```System``` interface containing the ```Epitaph```
event, which would be the parent of all other interface messages.  Epitaphs, on
their own, do not warrant such a large change.  There are also currently two
implementation hurdles to this.  First, derived types do not currently work,
although that is supposed to change soon.  Next, because this proposal changes
the runtime, and the FIDL parser / generator depends on the runtime, introducing
a System message and trying to use it in the runtime would result in a circular
dependency.

The API changes that will result from this FTP will not prevent Epitaph support
from moving into a future System message.

An idea was floated of incorporating some epitaph handling into the source
language, allowing the ```zx_status``` flag to be mapped as a FIDL-defined enum.
This is deferred to future work.


The proposed implementation is racy.  If one thread writes a message
concurrently with another thread closing the channel, the epitaph may be written
prior to the other thread's message, but before the call to
```zx_channel_close()```.  Alternatives include locking the channel or providing
